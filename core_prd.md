Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Rubik’s Cube Learning Application
1. Project Overview
The Rubik’s Cube Learning Application is an interactive, visually appealing web platform designed to teach users how to solve a Rubik’s cube through a customizable 3D interface. It combines educational content, personalization, and gamification to create an engaging experience. The application will be built using modern web technologies—Next.js for the framework, Tailwind CSS and ShadCN for styling, and Three.js for 3D rendering—and developed with Cursor’s AI assistance to ensure maintainability and consistency. The process will start with a basic prototype and evolve into a feature-rich, optimized product through iterative phases.
2. Objectives
* Educational: Deliver a "Learn to Cube" section with step-by-step animations based on badmephisto’s content.
* Customization: Offer extensive personalization for the Rubik’s cube, including edge chamfering and surface/edge effects.
* Interactivity: Enable intuitive controls via keyboard (WASD or arrows, B, Space) and mouse for 3D navigation.
* Engagement: Add dynamic backgrounds, a Mafia/GTA-style radio, leaderboards, personal bests, and purchasable skins.
* Technical: Achieve a fast, responsive application targeting 60 FPS, with a focus on scalability and iterative improvement.
3. Target Audience
* Beginners learning to solve the Rubik’s cube.
* Enthusiasts seeking customization and competition.
* Users who enjoy immersive, gamified learning experiences.
4. Features and Requirements
4.1 Core Features
* Interactive 3D Rubik’s Cube:
    * Built with Three.js for smooth 3D rendering.
    * Keyboard Controls:
        * WASD or arrow keys: Move the cube (rotate faces or adjust perspective).
        * B and Space: Turn the cube in opposing directions (e.g., clockwise/counterclockwise).
    * Mouse Interaction:
        * Navigate around the cube in 3D space (orbit controls).
        * Future exploration: Pointer/click actions (e.g., selecting faces—details TBD).
* Highly Customizable Cube:
    * Edge Chamfer: Adjustable from straight edges to near-spherical (ball-like) shapes.
    * Surface Effects: Optional 3D effects or glow on the cube’s surface.
    * Edge Effects: Optional 3D glow or enhancements on individual cubelets and the entire cube.
*  Section:
    * Animated tutorials based on badmephisto’s content (e.g., Beginner’s Method, F2L).
    * Step-by-step breakdown with text and actions derived from spoken material.
    * Interactive cube animations to demonstrate moves.
* Dynamic Backgrounds:
    * Customizable Three.js backgrounds (e.g., nature, abstract styles).
* Audio Experience:
    * Mafia/GTA-style radio with selectable music tracks.
* Gamification:
    * Leaderboard for solving times.
    * Personal best tracking.
    * Skins and refinements available via in-app purchases (e.g., via Stripe).
4.2 Technical Requirements
* Framework: Next.js for SSR and performance.
* Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first) and ShadCN (reusable components).
* 3D Rendering: Three.js for cube and background effects.
* Development Tool: Cursor with custom rules for AI-assisted coding.
* Performance: Optimize for 60 FPS on mid-range devices.
* Responsiveness: Mobile-first design, compatible across devices.
4.3 Development Phases
To ensure a working prototype evolves into a polished product, the project will progress through these phases:
1. Prototype Phase (1-2 weeks):
    * Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN.
    * Implement a basic Three.js cube with WASD (or arrows), B, and Space controls, plus mouse orbit navigation.
    * Create a static "Learn to Cube" page with placeholder content.
    * Focus on core interactivity and bug-free controls.
    * Deliverable: A minimal, functional MVP.
2. Feature Expansion (2-4 weeks):
    * Add cube customization (chamfer, surface/edge effects).
    * Implement dynamic Three.js backgrounds and the radio feature.
    * Develop initial "Learn to Cube" animations using badmephisto’s content.
    * Add basic leaderboard and personal best tracking.
    * Test for performance and usability, iterating as needed.
3. Polishing and Finalization (2-3 weeks):
    * Refine UI with ShadCN components and Tailwind CSS.
    * Optimize Three.js rendering for speed and smoothness.
    * Integrate payment system for skins (e.g., Stripe).
    * Conduct user testing, tweak based on feedback, and deploy to production (e.g., Vercel).
5. User Stories
* As a learner, I want animated tutorials to guide me step-by-step so I can solve the cube efficiently.
* As a customizer, I want to adjust my cube’s edges and add effects to make it unique.
* As a competitor, I want leaderboards and personal bests to track my progress.
* As a user, I want intuitive WASD/B/Space and mouse controls for seamless interaction.
* As an audiophile, I want a Mafia/GTA-style radio to enjoy while solving.
6. Success Metrics
* 70%+ user retention after one week.
* 20% reduction in solving time for beginners post-tutorials.
* 500+ active users within one month of launch.
* 4+ star average rating for visuals and usability.
7. Risks and Mitigation
* Risk: Three.js performance issues.
    * Mitigation: Use level-of-detail (LOD) techniques and test on low-end devices.
* Risk: Adapting badmephisto’s content is time-consuming.
    * Mitigation: Manually transcribe key sections initially, explore collaboration later.
* Risk: Payment integration delays.
    * Mitigation: Leverage Stripe’s SDK and test early.
8. Deliverables
* Functional web app with all core features.
* GitHub repository with source code and Cursor rules.
* User guide and "Learn to Cube" documentation.
* Deployed app on a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel).
